# IMPORTANT
The above text reminds users to be aware that ChatGPT (2023-03-31 20:17) cannot register new accounts, so the use of the ChatGPTWeb method with unknown security is strongly not recommended. Users should evaluate the risks themselves. The purpose of this reminder is to alert users to be cautious about security issues when using ChatGPTWeb.

# INTRODUCTION
Portal is a cross-platform tool designed to integrate the capabilities of ChatGPT into users' workflows.

Specifically, it allows users to send any selected text to ChatGPT for processing via a keyboard shortcut, and then return the result to the user's clipboard or at the cursor position (achieving a typewriter effect). This means that you can immediately access the power of ChatGPT in most applications that do not have access to ChatGPT capabilities.
